The DGT Centaur with DGT Centaur Mods installed is capable of emulating the later DGT Pegasus board. To do this select "DGT Pegasus" from the menu.

![Pegasus Menu Option](/assets/images/pegasusmenu.jpg)

You will see the following screen.

When you see this screen you are ready to connect to your board as if it is a Pegasus. Any app compatible with the Pegasus, including the original DGT Chess App https://digitalgametechnology.com/faq/pegasus/where-can-i-download-the-dgt-chess-app , will connect to and work with the board. The apps functionality, such as playing on Lichess, is then available to you.

When you are done hit the back button on the board (it looks like an arrow curling back on itself) to exit Pegasus emulation mode.

Important to us is that your body can maintain its original functionality should you want it to. So our [installation processes](/new-windows-setup-tool/) include methods to copy across the software from the original SD-card that was inside your Centaur.

If you install using one of these methods then the topmost item in your menu will be a link to start the original DGT Centaur software.

Note: The original software knows nothing about DGT Centaur Mods so has no official way of getting back to the main menu. You either will either need to power your board off and on again, or you can quit back to the main menu from the web interface ( http://centaur.local/ )

We reverse engineered how the DGT Centaur chess board works and are writing software to make it do more. We started back in April 2021, in the times of corona lockdowns, and are still at it years later. We have a pretty solid understanding of the internals, but every time we think we know it all, we're surprised by finding something new.

We've been applying our 1000s of hours of reverse engineering by proactively creating functionality for the DGT Centaur. The board can now emulate a newer DGT board (the DGT Pegasus), allowing you to use its app to play online. You can play multiple chess engines. You can do analyis. You can access PGN files from a network share. And so, so, so, much more. We've turned the DGT Centaur (modified by our software) into the greatest, and most functional, electronic chess board in existence.

Our philosophy is simple - we believe that if you own a product you should get as much functionality out of it as it is capable of and you can imagine, we want our software to be free and open, we want *you* to be able to do what *you* want with your board. You're in control (for example, we have an auto-update system but we don't turn it on by default. We ask you to - because it's your board). We believe in being open and honest, and in iterating code fast from its original experimental stage based on our reverse engineering. We'd love your help, whether you're an experienced programmer or an avid user and bug reporter. We're also happy if you just want to use the software to, you know, play chess.
